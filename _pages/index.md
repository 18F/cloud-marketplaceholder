title: Gov cloud market
---

The cloud marketplace is a TTS Office of Acquisition project exploring the opportunity to turn Apps.gov from a SaaS discovery tool into a SaaS procurement tool.

## Hypotheses
**A SaaS procurement tool could:**
- dramatically reduce the amount of time it takes for an agency to acquire SaaS licenses and to increase/decrease the number of licenses used,
- show public servants some of the SaaS tools their colleagues use,
- clarify purchasing next steps,
- help move away from purchasing cards, and
- better inform SaaS purchasing decisions.

## Prototype

The team has created a prototype to spark conversation centered around the idea of a “store” where government employees could obtain cloud-based software. Please note it isn’t meant to represent a recommended direction or design.

## Approach
- The team is taking a ‘Wizard of Oz’ approach to initial development: a lightweight ordering interface, but a lot of manual work happening behind the scenes.
- Products and customers will be onboarded slowly instead of a ‘big bang’ approach.


## Emerging policies
- 2017 NDAA § 880 - allows for procurement of “innovative” technologies up to $10 million so long as the offers undergo “peer review”
- 2018 NDAA § 801 (not passed) - also known as the Thornberry bill, would allow government to waive competition requirements when buying off a commercial marketplace
