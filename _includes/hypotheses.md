### After initial discussions with SaaS users, license managers, purchasers, and IT managers, the cloud marketplace team believes SaaS procurement tool could:

* dramatically reduce the amount of time it takes for an agency to acquire SaaS licenses and to increase/decrease the number of licenses used,
* show public servants some of the SaaS tools their colleagues use,
* clarify purchasing next steps,
* help move away from purchasing cards, and
* better inform SaaS purchasing decisions.


## Our approach
The SaaS acquisition process contains a number of steps, some of which are easily automated, many of which are not. To get to a minimum-viable product, initial development will be of a lightweight ordering interface, but with a lot of manual work happening behind the scenes—otherwise known as ‘Wizard of Oz’ prototyping.

Products and customers will be onboarded gradually instead of using a ‘big bang’ approach. Under this approach, we'll test a few products with a few customers. Then, we'll expand to a few products and many customers. Finally, we'll expand to many products and many customers.
