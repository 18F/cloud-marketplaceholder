## Hypothesis
#### After initial discussions with SaaS users, license managers, purchasers, and IT managers ...
### The cloud marketplace team believes a SaaS procurement tool could:
* dramatically reduce the amount of time it takes for an agency to acquire SaaS licenses and to increase/decrease the number of licenses used,
* show public servants some of the SaaS tools their colleagues use,
* clarify purchasing next steps,
* help move away from purchasing cards, and
* better inform SaaS purchasing decisions.


## Our approach
* Initial development will be of a lightweight ordering interface, but with a lot of manual work happening behind the scenes—otherwise known as ‘Wizard of Oz’ prototyping.
* Products and customers will be onboarded gradually instead of using a ‘big bang’ approach.
