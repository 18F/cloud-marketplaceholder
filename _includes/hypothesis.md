### After initial discussions with government SaaS users, license managers, purchasers, and IT managers, the cloud marketplace team believes a digital SaaS procurement tool could:
* reduce the amount of time it takes for an agency to acquire SaaS licenses and to increase/decrease the number of licenses used,
* show public servants some of the SaaS tools their colleagues use,
* clarify purchasing next steps,
* help move away from purchasing cards, and
* better inform SaaS purchasing decisions.

## Approach
* Initially, we’re developing a lightweight ordering interface, but most of the behind-the-scenes work remains manual—otherwise known as ‘Wizard of Oz’ prototyping.
* Instead of a ‘big bang’ approach, we plan to onboard products and customers gradually.
