Based on initial discussions with government SaaS users, license managers, purchasers, and IT managers, the cloud marketplace team believes a digital SaaS procurement tool could:
* reduce the amount of time it takes for an agency to acquire SaaS licenses and to increase/decrease the number of licenses used,
* show public servants some of the SaaS tools their colleagues use,
* clarify purchasing next steps,
* help move away from purchasing cards, and
* better inform SaaS purchasing decisions.

## Approach
* Our initial approach to the prototype is to develop a lightweight ordering interface. Most of the behind-the-scenes work remains manual—otherwise known as ‘Wizard of Oz’ prototyping. This may be the direction we continue in or it may not. But we want to know what this interface does for users.
* We plan to onboard products and customers gradually—choosing those who meet criteria we are expanding to address.
